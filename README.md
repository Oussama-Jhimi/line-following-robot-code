# Line-Following Robot

This project implements a basic line-following robot using infrared (IR) sensors and an Arduino microcontroller. The robot is capable of detecting and following a black line on a white surface, making it ideal for robotics and embedded systems learning.

## Features

- IR sensor-based line detection  
- Real-time motor control for line tracking  
- Basic obstacle handling (optional)  
- Easy to modify for different line paths and speeds  
- Suitable for educational purposes and robotics competitions

## Components Used

- **Arduino mega**  
- **L298N motor driver module**  
- **DC motors with wheels**  
- **Chassis and battery pack**  


## Files Included

- Arduino source code (`.ino` file)   
- Instructions for calibration and tuning  

## Usage

1. Assemble the robot chassis and connect all components as per the wiring diagram  
2. Upload the Arduino code to your board using the Arduino IDE  
3. Place the robot on a track with a black line over a white surface  
4. Adjust sensor threshold values if necessary for optimal detection  
5. Power the robot and watch it follow the line!

## Customization

- Adjust motor speed in the code for smoother turns  
- Add obstacle detection using ultrasonic sensors  
- Upgrade to PID control for more precise tracking
